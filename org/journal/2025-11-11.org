* Journal
Not much to report today.  Managed to get to the gym in the morning, got a good workout in!  All told I was in the office just before 9.  I think that's the realistic daily start time - it'll be tough to do much better than that consistently.

Adam is doing pretty good work.  He's not a straight up dev but he's doing pretty well!

I'm having a real impulse to talk to J&D about my diagnosis, but I'm not sure the timing is going to work out well to do it on friday.  Maybe I can catch them or yak pack this weekend or something?  I could also try to pull the "its important" card but that's such a drag.
