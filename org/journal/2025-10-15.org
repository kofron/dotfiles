* Morning checklist
** DONE Sleep check

Slept well.  7.5 hours, 94 according to sleep tracker.  Over an hour in deep sleep.  Got to bed around 1030 and slept until 625.  Woke up from kitchen lights (I think)
** DONE Tinnitus check

About a 4/10.  High pitched, not much lower tone audibly present, but the beat is there.

* Journal

Yesterday went ok, made a lot of progress on work stuff.  I felt pretty focused and able to get shit done.  I think turning the dial down on the prednisone has really helped get my sleep into better shape and also my focus.  Definitely feels like an improvement.  But I'm feeling pretty checked out at PSL otherwise.  I just want to get all my stuff done and head out.  I'm hoping I can have the first round of conversation with Greg on thursday and then TA friday?  It's challenging to juggle those two but I think it needs to be Greg first.

Katie is completely convinced that we're going to break up, and it's coming out as a lot of anger and frustration.  She's just kind of pissed and pent up and everything is getting funneled through that presentiment she's having.  I don't really know what to do about that - I'm trying to be there for her, but it's pretty tough to be both the "at fault" party and also the comforter.

* Notes from today
refactr: Openai codex auth - need to verify that we can pass arbitrary api keys or profiles.  In theory we're able to but for now the embedded codex agent gets invoked with the default openai creds.
