About a 3 I think.  Mostly high pitched with a slight warble.  We did go out and I had a couple of drinks last night.

* Journal
We decided (somewhat painfully) to not go to thailand.  My most recent blood panel was still super high and so we had to make the decision sort of last minute, but it was clearly too high to be considered safe.  The doc increased my hydrea to 1g/day and I'm taking it twice a day, morning and night.  Clearly it was not working at 500mg, so lets try 1g.  I've got a follow-up with her when we're back on the 14th so I imagine we'll get our next round of test results that week.  I've also got leveque that following week on monday, which is kind of annoying.

Meidcine is definitely impacting my stomach once it kicks in, but it seems to be getting better every day.  It's weird that it doesn't seem to be nauseating, only makes my shits weird.  But again, it seems to be abating.  I'm holding out hope that it will eventually improve blood flow and maybe even impact my hearing, but who knows.

We drove down to portland yesterday - got here in 3.5hrs or so.  The drive was good and uneventful (in a good way).  There were a couple of stressful moments with bad drivers, but it all worked out.  Our food last night (malaysian street food at omas) was insanely good, especially this curry sauce & roti thing they had.  Portland is way cooler than I remember it being!

I am loving org for journaling and really want to use it more for other stuff.  I'm going to get into it.  I'm thinking maybe I could also use projectile to keep org and project separate????

Also: Stay more hydrated!!!!!

Whenever possible, where we have domain language that we use when communicating with customers/team, it should be reflected in the codebase
*** Forbid importing from submodules & dont export private interfaces
*** Forbid importing inside packages without @ reference
e.g. no import {X} from "../../packages/Y/a/b/c" -> import {X} from "@super/Y"
