Probably like a 2/10.  Higher pitched.  It's very clear that my hearing is worse now than it was a few weeks ago with the steroids in full effect (I'm down to 5mg daily, will be 5 every other day next week).

Total debt is 30k.  I've payed 4 which leaves 26.  But 2500 more piles up each month.  For Nov,Dec,Jan,Feb,Marc, that's an additional 12.5k.  So if I just increase the payment to 2500, then pay 19 as a gift, that's down to 11.  That's the safest thing.  Then, in April after the tax year rolls over, I can send another 11 and there are no consequences.  That also lets us deduct the remainder.  So for the 19, I'll wind up owing 15% which is ~3k on the sale.
