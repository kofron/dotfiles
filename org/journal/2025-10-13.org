* Thailand :thailand:travel:
Alright, putting together some options.

Friends are 28 (JH) / 29 (AT) / 30 (SM) - 11 (SM) / 13 (TA) / ? (HJ).

I'm completely off - Katie told her boss 10/29 for "two weeks"

SEA <-> BKK
- 10/29 -> 11/11 EVA BR 25 / BR 68 (layover in taipei for 2 hrs) 813$ [https://www.google.com/travel/flights/s/udnxqPCuwVW5tFan7]
- 10/28 -> 11/13 Korean KE 42 (layover in incheon for 1 hrs) 675$ [https://www.google.com/travel/flights/s/g86QpftecuSpECQs8]

DMK (bangkok) <-> CNX
- Thai lion is 110$pp RT from 11/1 to 11/5.  Easy

There's nothing direct to trat from CNX.  Plane ticket from CNX to trat via BKK is like 150$pp one-way on bangkok airlines and the times kinda suck. Best option there time-wise is 210$pp and gets in at 145p.

** Koh Mak
- Staying at Plub Pla 11/5-11/10 - 651.85$ for 5 nights in the grand deluxe room
