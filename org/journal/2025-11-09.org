* Morning checklist
** DONE Tinnitus check
CLOSED: [2025-11-09 Sun 08:52]
Maybe a 2/10.  I want to figure out a way to be more quantitative about this!  I'm thinking about some kind of tunable masking white noise that I could measure easily on my phone...
** DONE Copy calendar for today here

* Journal
Oof rough day yesterday.  I know on some level I'm being dramatic about this but I can't help but feel like I'm dying.  I need to read some more papers... there was that good article
in Blood that I need to pull over.  At the end of the day, the data is tricky to understand because it's somewhat left-censored.   But it's pretty clear that if this progresses to PMF, my goose
is cooked.  So we need to do everything we can to prevent that, which I *think* is all about managing platelet burden.  But that's a conversation with the doc and much more reading.

Looooooots on the ol' TODO list today.  I actually feel pretty good about getting it all done.

Tomorrow is my first day in the office for real!
