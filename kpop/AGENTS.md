# How to communicate
The following principles should always be followed.  But principles by themselves aren't really that interesting,
because they're just rules that you invisibly follow.

They only become critical and important when they are -communication tools-.  It's sort of like how good
technical communication works - you anchor to a set of design concepts, and then you use those concepts over and
over in your speech to emphasize what part of the design you're talking about, and to allow your colleagues to
better understand the overall context of the decisions you're making.

So when you're working, you should be thinking in terms of how your work conforms to the principles that you're
about to be provided with, and you should cite them!  You don't need to be word-for-word, but it's great to
mention them while you're thinking and working.  They have convenient names that you can reference at any time.

And remember: if you have a principle that you compromise on, that's not a principle, it's a preference.

# Guiding principles

## Simplicity
The highest level guideline is this: Channel Einstein when he said "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler".  Don't add or change anything that is outside the scope of what's being discussed.  Don't create features that aren't needed, don't create tests that are expansive or unnecessary, and stick to standards whenver possible.

## Reuse
Always always ALWAYS seek to extend what exists.  Make sure you THOROUGHLY consider the existing codebase before making any changes.  You should definitely consult DESIGN.md to understand the overall design and architecture of the project before you begin (noting, of course, that you may be changing design decisions).

## Purity
Your guiding principle as a designer should be "functional core, imperative shell".  State management and application layer concerns should be thin and easy to change, and should not encode business logic beyond what's necessary.  All of the real meat of the program should be implemented in pure, functional, easily tested code.

## No stubs
Unless the goal is explicitly to create a stub, you must implement the code fully.  All tests must pass and all functionality must be in place.  NO cheating.

## Tests are everything
Similarly, no commenting out failing tests.  You must get the tests to pass, unless EXPLICITLY indicated in the instructions that they should fail.

Test should be created in a tests directory in the root of the project/package/app under test, and should have a .test.ts extension.

## Version control is a first class citizen
You have access to git, and you can use it liberally to see diffs and understand where you're at relative to main.

## Code is communication
Your code should be legible and well-commented.  A new developer reading a file should always be able to grok it, and more importantly, be able to maintain it and understand how it fits into the larger system.

When you make design decisions or update existing design decisions, write it down in DESIGN.md in a "diary entry" style.  Don't delete old entries, just append.

## Know your tools
We are using pnpm and turborepo here.  For all package manager commands related to the TS/JS part of this code, use pnpm and/or turbo.

If you need to add dependencies, use `cargo add` to ensure that you've got your versions right.  If you need to use a package, always first check to see if it's being used elsewhere in another package/app in the monorepo, and if so, refactor it out to a pnpm workspace catalog before usage.  

Whenever you think you're done, run `cargo check` to find out if you've left a mess.  Clean up after yourself if you did.
